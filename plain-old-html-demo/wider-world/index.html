	<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dqzlxcllu/image/upload/c_crop,h_1963,x_2759,y_1960/c_fill,h_500,w_500/v1660004846/hello_world_nasa_earth_day_mvfbdu.jpg" alt="Crop of North America during the day (the size of this version is 500 pixels x 500 pixels)" />
	<p><strong>'c_crop,h_1963,x_2759,y_1960'</strong>: The 1st section of the URL between 'upload' and 'v1660004846' transforms our image. 'c_crop' crops our image so that it starts 2759 pixels from left and 1960 pixels from the top, with a width and height of 1960 pixels.</p>
	<p><strong>'c_fill,h_500,w_500'</strong>: The 2nd section of the URL between 'upload' and 'v1660004846' transforms our image. 'c_fill' resizes our image so that the height is 500 and the width is also 500.<p/>
	<p>It runs both these transformations before the image is downloaded so the download is much faster than if we took the original image (8192 pixels width and height), then cropped and resized it in our browser.</p>	
	<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dqzlxcllu/image/upload/v1660004846/hello_world_nasa_earth_day_mvfbdu.jpg">You can visit that full image here</a> to see how much bigger it is. Please note: that's the same URL as our "hello world" version with the '/c_crop,h_1963,x_2759,y_1960/c_fill,h_500,w_500' segments removed.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h2>It's easy to add additional transformations into the URL by adding additional URL segments</h2>

	<p><strong>'a_10'</strong>: Rotated 10 degrees clockwise.</p>
	<p>Note, we've changed the extension to png to have transparency background around the edge of the image due to the rotation. Cloudinary appears to output in most formats without issue no matter what the input file format was.</p>

Offset it from the South East corner by 135 pixels across and 55 pixels up. Devs_Connect_Logo_3_gdlfrq is the id of the logo image and 'l_' is the Cloudinary overlay parameter.</p>
